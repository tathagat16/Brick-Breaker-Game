# Brick-Breaker-Game
Brick Breaker game is a Java-Spring based Application where user can play the game, score points and it also includes bonuses!
Here is how simple brick game works: 
You have layers of colored bricks and a tossed up ball with which to break the layers.
Controlling the momentum of the ball is a paddle which you have to maneuver from side to side.  
When the ball is bounced up by the paddle, it will hit a brick and then the brick is gone.
After that the ball will come down, if the paddle misses the ball, life is lost(consists of 3 lifes without bonuses).
Users can use the gamepad to control the position of paddle. At the same time, there will be music outputs to match different game effects.
When all the bricks are destroyed, the player advances to a new level.
